## DEPLOYMENT FIX: How to Make Your Website Live

To fix the issue where this page is showing instead of your website, please follow these steps:

1.  **Go to your GitHub repository settings.**
2.  Click on **"Pages"** in the left sidebar.
3.  Under the "Build and deployment" section, change the **Source** from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**.
4.  Make a small change and push it to your `main` branch to trigger the new deployment process.

This will use the new workflow file I added to build and deploy your site correctly. After a few minutes, your live URL will show the proper website.
